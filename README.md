# SimpleNPM

SimpleNPM is a basic implementation of an npm-like package manager in Node.js. It supports installing packages with version specifications and handles basic dependency resolution.

## Features

- Command-line interface supporting the `install` command
- Version specification support (e.g., `package@1.2.3` or `package@^2.0.0`)
- Deduplication of child dependencies
- Recursive dependency installation
- Basic error handling
- Package integrity verification

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Install the required `semver` package:
   ```
   npm install semver
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```
   node simple-npm.js install <package-name>[@<version>] [<package-name>[@<version>] ...]
   ```

Example:
```
node simple-npm.js install express@4.17.1 lodash@^4.0.0
```

## Limitations and Future Improvements

While SimpleNPM provides basic functionality, there are several areas for improvement to make it more robust and feature-complete:

1. **Performance Optimization**: 
   - Implement parallel downloads and installations for better performance with large dependency trees.
   - Add caching mechanisms to avoid redundant downloads and operations.

2. **Dependency Resolution**:
   - Enhance the version resolution algorithm to handle more complex scenarios and edge cases.
   - Implement a more sophisticated strategy for resolving conflicts in the dependency graph.

3. **Filesystem Operations**:
   - Improve handling of file permissions and ownership.
   - Implement fully atomic installations to ensure consistency in case of failures.

4. **Platform Compatibility**:
   - Extend support for different operating systems and environments.
   - Replace platform-specific commands with cross-platform Node.js APIs.

5. **Network Resilience**:
   - Implement retry logic for network failures.
   - Add support for configurable timeouts and connection limits.

6. **Lockfile Support**:
   - Generate and use a lockfile to ensure reproducible builds.
   - Implement lockfile parsing and versioning.

7. **Updates and Uninstallation**:
   - Add support for updating installed packages.
   - Implement package uninstallation functionality.

8. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement more robust package integrity checks.
   - Add support for verifying package signatures.
   - Implement vulnerability scanning for installed packages.

9. **User Interface**:
   - Improve console output with colorization and formatting.
   - Add a progress bar for long-running operations.
   - Implement verbose and silent modes for different levels of output.

10. **Configuration**:
    - Add support for configuration files to customize behavior.
    - Implement support for different registries and scopes.

11. **Testing**:
    - Develop a comprehensive test suite covering various scenarios and edge cases.
    - Implement integration tests with actual npm registry interactions.

12. **Documentation**:
    - Expand this README with more detailed usage instructions and examples.
    - Create API documentation for internal classes and methods.
